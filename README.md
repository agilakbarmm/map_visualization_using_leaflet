This repository demonstrates interactive map visualizations using Leaflet.js, a lightweight, open-source JavaScript library for maps. The project includes examples of how to:

Render dynamic maps with customizable markers, popups, and tooltips.
Integrate additional features like layers, geolocation, and clustering.
Utilize third-party basemaps (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Mapbox).
Handle GeoJSON data for advanced spatial analysis.
Whether you're building web apps with geospatial features or just exploring the power of Leaflet, this repository provides a practical starting point for developers and GIS enthusiasts.

Feel free to contribute or report any issues!
